DataTypes:
     Datatypes are used to define the type of data.There are primarily two types of data types available
     i. primitive data types
     ii. non primitive data types

     primitive datatypes are used to store the value directly and these are immutable (can't change)
       eg: number, string, boolean, undefined, null
     non primitive datatypes are used to store values based on primitive datatypes and these are mutable.These are also called reference datatypes
        eg: functions,arrays, objects etc..,


    i. number: Any numerical value in JS is considered as number
      eg:  let x=25;
      console.log(typeof x)

     Browser provides some default methods for numbers such as
       a. toFixed(noOfFractionDigits): it returns new value that got round off per n number of digits after decimal
       eg: let a=25.1463;
       a.toFixed(2); //25.15
       b. toString(baseNumber) : it is used to convert number into string and  it can also convert number into any based
       eg: let a=16;
       a.toString(2) // '1000'
