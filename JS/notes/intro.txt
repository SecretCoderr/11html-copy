How to include JS into HTML?
   i. internal JS : we can combine JS code in HTML using "script" element
   eg: <body>
            <script>
               console.log("hello world")
            </script>
        </body>
   ii. External JS : we can write js code separately in .js files and attach them using following code
       <script src="./script.js"></script>

   <body>
            <script src="./script.js"></script>
        </body>
  //script.js
     console.log("hello world")

   Good practice is  always add css at the end of head and js at the end of body 


task 1: create a js file and print your details in console and attach it to HTML

  ---> In JS, semi colon is automatically inserted for every line or statement at the end but if two statements are in the same line, need to separated using semicolon, best practice is mentioning semicolons always
  ---> JS is case sensitive( uppercase and lowercase are difference)
