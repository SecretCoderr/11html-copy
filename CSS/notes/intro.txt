CSS stands cascadig style sheets
CSS is used to design or to provide layout for the webpage. CSS is intoduced in 1993 and it's one of the powerful design standard language
CSS can be applied to html elements using three ways:
i. inline CSS: it applies styling to an element using "style" as a attribute
syntax: <element style="">something</element

ii. internal CSS: it applies styling to an element or multiple elements using "style" as a element
<style>
    selector{
        //properties
    }
</style>

selector are used to select an element. 
 1. we can select elements using tagname
 2. we can select elements with same classname using .classname
 3. we can select element with id using #idname

preference: !important> id>class>tag

iii. external css: we can include css in separate file with extension .css and use it in HTML using Link tag

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css" />

preference: Inline > Internal > external
it is always better to write external so that html and css will not be mixed

CSS comments are multi lined starts with /* and ends with */


colors:
colors speak the brand. use minimal number od colors to avoid user's complexity
we can assign colors in CSS using
   i. colorname
   ii. rgb(red,green,blue) - each one takes from 0 to 255
   iii. rgba(red,greeen,blue,alpha) -- alpha ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, it represents opacity
   iv. hsl(hue,saturation,lightness) -- 
   hue means degree of colorname
   saturation is % of darkness
   lightness is % of lightness
   v. hsla(hue,saturation,lightness,alpha)--alpha ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, it represents opacity
   vi. hexcode: every color will have a hexadecimal number

background:
  we can assign background-color using 'background-color' property
  background-color:red/rgb(255,0,0)/rgba(255,0,0,1)/hsl(0, 100.00%, 50.00%)/hsl(0, 100.00%, 50.00%)/#ff0000;

  background-image : background Image can take gradients , images with several properties
   i. linear-gradient: used to show multiple colour mixtures linear way(left to right/right to left/top to bottom/bottom to top)
   background-image:linear-gradient(to top,red,yellow);
   we can assign unlimited colors and different direction or even angle
   ii. radial-gradient: used to show multiple color mixtures in circular way
      background-image:radial-gradient(red,yellow);
   iii. conic-gradient: used to show multiple color mixtures in cone shaped way
      background-image:conic-gradient(red 30deg,yellow 40deg ,green);
    iv. background-image:url('path') -- used to insert an image as background
    v. background-repeat: repeat/no-repeat/repeat-x/repeat-y
    vi. background-size:auto/cover/contain
    vii. background-position:top/left/right/bottom/center
    viii.background-attachement: fixed/scroll

fonts:  fonts represents the brand.
There are 5 font families existed.
   a. serif: these fonts will have a stroke at the corner eg: Times new roman
   b. sans-serif: these fonts will not have any strokes at the corner eg: calibri,aria,poppins
   c. monospace: monospace letters contains same height and equal gap eg: space-mono
   d. cursive: cursive fonts are kind of slant sleeping letters

px - pixels are the smallest unit of measure in design. whole screen is divided into mxn(resolution) number of pixels
% -- it represents percent of parent size
