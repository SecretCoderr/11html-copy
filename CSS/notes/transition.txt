Transition: It is used to observe the change happened from one state to another state
you need to mention transition in the initial state.
transition: properties  duration  timing-function
  properties are used to mention which property change need to observered or can say 'all' to observe all changes
  duration is used to mention the time it takes to change from one state to another (in s or ms)
  timing function: it represents the speed it follows through the change. There are so many timing functions like
  a. ease-in: it starts slowly and becomes faster
  b. ease-out: it starts faster and becomes slow
  c. ease-in-out: it starts slow, later fasts and ends slowly
  d. ease: it gradually increases the speed
  e. linear: maintain constant speed

  Animations: Animations are nothing but multiple transitions where it starts without any user intervention
  Every animation contains keyframes

  eg: 
  .element{
    animation-name: slideDown 2s ease;
  }
  @keyframes slideDown{
    0%{
      transform:translateY(0px)
    }
    100%{
      transform:translateY(500px)
    }
  }
