Code Editors: code editors are the software/tools where you can write/run your code
we use visual studio code in our course
why ?
   1. vscode have plenty of awesome extensions
   2. More than 80% of web developers users VSCode

Download & Install VSCode

Open vscode --> file ---> open folder

goto Extensions --> install "Live Server by Ritwick Dey"


Web developement: Web development contains multiple technologies used to developed websites or web apps
For basic frontend, we use HTML,CSS,JS.
   HTML -- structure of the webpage
   CSS -- styling/designing of the webpage
   JS -- functionality of the webpage

History: 
  In late 1980's at CERN lab, Tim Berners lee proposed an idea of sending documents as hyperlinks. The Communication through the world to see these hyperlinks , he called "world wide web"
  In 1989, he wrote first code to keep document in HyperLink and he called it as "Hyper text Markup Language"
  Officially, CERN released HTML in 1991. The First Browser, "worldwideweb" later renamed as "nexus" used first HTML.
  "netscape" is the popular browser of 90's.

   They formed a group called W3C(world wide web consortium). This group will set rules to browsers for supporting web development
   HTML --> XHTML (XML) --> DHTML --> HTMX
  current version of HTML is HTML5

HTML:
  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. it is used to define the structure or skeleton of the web page.
  In HTML, everything is decided by Tags
    for eg: <p>  -- paragraph open Tag
            </p> -- paragraph close Tag
    
The combined value of open tag and close tag with its content is called element
 paragraph element ==> <p>  dghdfghdf </p>

 Basic HTML : HTML code always within HTML element. HTML element have two childern HEAD and BODY
    HEAD -- used for the meta data -- data about the data
    BODY -- used for the content of website.

 <html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
 </html>
   HEAD can contain childern like TITLE
   <html>
    <head>
      <title>My web site</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
 </html>

The leftside gaps of a tag makes the more readable. this is called "indentation"
For good indentation, you can alsi use an extension "prettier"

In HTML, comments can be used for user readability within
<!--  and -->

Every element in HTML will have attributes , they are like properties of that element. every attribute will have a value

 VSCode Provides shortcuts to generate template codes. These are called "emmets"

 Eg: To generate HTML basic template, you can use html:5+enter or !+enter
 
 Basic HTML Template:
 <!DOCTYPE html> <!-- DOCTYPE defines  the following document is html type-->
<html lang="en"> <!-- HTML open tag with attribute lang and value "en"-->
<head><!-- head open tag-->
	<meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- meta tag is used for meta data- extra data. it is having charset (character set) attribute with value UTF(unicode transmission format) 8 -->
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<!-- this line indicates our screen with have width equal to device width and initial scale(zoom) 100%-->
	<title>Document</title><!-- title defines the title of the web page, on tab section-->
</head> <!-- head close tag-->
<body> <!-- body open tag -->
   <!-- actual content -->
</body> <!-- body close tag -->
</html> <!--  html close tag -->
