Tables are used to represent Data in rows and columns. horizontal ones are called rows and vertical one are called columns.
Table can be created using 'table' tag
Inside the table each row, will have 'tr' tag
Inside each row, we can have td(table data) or 
th(table heading)
th will be always bold and centered
td will be normal text.

td/th values can be any element or plain text
eg:
  <table>
     <tr>
       <th>name</th>
       <th>Relation</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>prasad</td>
       <td>myself</td>
     </tr>
  </table>

  To combine multiple rows you can use rowspan
  To combine multiple columns you can use, colspan
  eg: <td rowspan="2">text</td> will combine two rows
      <td colspan="2">text</td> will combine two columns

  we can make the code more readable and SEO friendly using
  thead,tbody and tfoot semantic elements.
<table>
    <thead>
       <tr>
       <th>name</th>
       <th>Relation</th>
     </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
       <tr>
        <td>prasad</td>
       <td>myself</td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  tables can also have caption tag to define the caption of the table.
